## Warframe Affinity Tracker
[Currently deployed on Vercel.](https://warframe-affinity-tracker.vercel.app/)

The app aims to help keeping track of your mastered warframes, weapons, companions, completed mission nodes and intrisincs. 

The save is automatically saved in cookies, but it can also be exported to a .json file that is used to load the save when no cookie data is present.



This is the first version of the tracker app and it will be improved and its functionalities are to be expanded.

Future plans:
* Search/filter lists
* Hide mastered items
* Show information about the cost of specific items, links to wiki
* World status 
## 

The app has been created with the use of NextJS, [@wfcd/warframe-items](https://github.com/WFCD/warframe-items) for the item data. And [HeroUI](https://github.com/heroui-inc/heroui) for the visual side.

#### Temporary readme for future improvement.
